# Underfed

A Dispatcharr plugin that moves a channel to its next source when the provider keeps
delivering the stream, but at a fraction of the bitrate the content needs.

Every failover in the chain waits for a source to *fail*. This one never does. The bytes
keep arriving, just not enough of them: the picture needs 4.4 Mbps and 1.0 Mbps shows up.
Nothing times out, nothing errors, nothing switches. The buffer drains, the player runs
out of segments, and viewers sit there watching a stall that no log explains.

Underfed reads the number that already exists and that nothing else acts on.

## Requirements

- Dispatcharr with the plugin system (the Plugins page)
- [reservoarr](https://github.com/brko7/reservoarr) as the stream profile, which writes the
  telemetry this plugin reads
- A Dispatcharr API key

## Install

From the Plugin Hub, or by unzipping the release into `/data/plugins/underfed` and pressing
refresh on the Plugins page. Enable the plugin, fill in the API key, press **Apply**.

**Leave Observe only on for the first evening.** It records what it would have switched and
changes nothing. Read the journal under Check status, then turn it off.

## Settings

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| API key | A Dispatcharr API key, from Settings → Users. The watcher needs it to read channel status and to change source |
| Observe only | Records what it would have done without doing it |
| Trigger below | Share of the content rate under which a source counts as underfed. 70 is a sensible floor: a source that healthy sits at 100 |
| Confirm for | How long the shortfall must last before acting. Short dips recover on their own |
| Switches per hour | Per channel. Stops it bouncing between two sources that are both weak |
| Ignore first | Right after a channel opens the measured content rate is not trustworthy yet |
| Stable after | A source that holds up this long is treated as recovered. A shorter recovery keeps the shortfall counting, so a source that flickers is still caught |
| Excluded channels | One channel name per line |
| reservoarr log | Where reservoarr writes `delaybuf.log`. Change it only if `RESV_LOG_DIR` was moved |
| Dispatcharr URL | Reached from inside the container |

## Actions

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| Apply settings | Starts the watcher, or restarts it with the new settings. Saving a setting changes nothing until Apply runs |
| Check status | Whether the watcher is running, and the journal of what it switched, skipped and failed |
| Replay the log | Runs the current thresholds over the whole log and reports how many times each source would have triggered. Nothing is touched, so it is the safe way to try a threshold before it goes live. It counts triggers, not switches: viewers, exclusions, the slate and the hourly limit are not in the log |
| Restart watcher | Starts it again if it is down, with the settings of the last Apply. Also runs by itself when a channel starts, at most once a minute |
| Stop watcher | Stops it. Channels keep whatever source they are on |

## How it works

reservoarr holds a cushion of stream and prints a line every fifteen seconds for every feed
it is pulling:

```
2026-09-08T20:18:57+0000 [202121.ts] cushion=0s(pcr) buf=0.1MB out=1.18Mbps
in=1.00Mbps crate=4.44Mbps in_total=1589MB reconnects=2 ccerr=1 ...
```

`crate` is what the picture needs. `in` is what the provider is sending. `cushion` is how
many seconds of stream are left in hand. When `in` sits well under `crate` and the cushion
has reached zero, the source is being starved and the viewer is about to see it. A feed whose
`crate` is under 0.5 Mbps is never judged: a content rate that low is not trustworthy.

The watcher follows that file, and when a feed stays under the threshold for the
confirmation window it calls `POST /proxy/ts/next_stream/<uuid>`, which is the same thing
the Dispatcharr interface does when you change source by hand. The channel moves to the next
entry in its chain and the viewer keeps watching.

It refuses to act when any of these is true:

- the channel is not streaming, or nobody is watching it
- the channel is in Excluded channels
- the watcher has seen the source for less than the warm-up window, where `crate` may still be settling: it counts from the first telemetry line it reads for that source, so it starts over after a gap of more than 45 seconds in the log or a watcher restart
- the channel has already been switched too often this hour
- the next entry in the chain is the fallback slate
- there is no entry after the current one

Everything it does, and everything it declines to do, goes to a journal with the numbers
that justified it.

## What this does not fix

A chain whose sources all come from the same upstream. If `Sky Sport Uno FHD`, `HD`, `SD`
and `HEVC` are four encodes of one feed, moving between them moves nothing. Underfed can
only reach for what the chain offers, so put a genuinely different list second.

It also cannot help a source that stops dead. That case already has a watchdog: reservoarr
reconnects after `RESV_STALL_S`, and Dispatcharr walks the chain after three failed attempts.
